# Biogas Forecasting with Machine Learning

This repository contains a collection of papers, models, and experiments focused on forecasting, using machine learning techniques.

## 📄 Contents

- 📁 `papers/`: PDF documents of technical reports and research papers related to forecasting methods.
- 📁 `models/`: Implementation of various machine learning models.
- 📁 `datasets/`: Preprocessed datasets used for training and evaluation.
- 📁 `results/`: Model outputs, plots, and performance evaluations.

## 🔍 Focus

The core objective is to explore and compare different machine learning techniques for time-series forecasting — ranging from classic **regression models** (e.g., Random Forests, Linear Regression) to modern **transformer-based deep learning architectures**.

The models are evaluated on their ability to:
- Predict outputs multiple steps into the future
- Handle multivariate inputs with high temporal resolution
- Generalize across various sampling intervals and input lengths

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python (mainly PyTorch)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Optuna (for hyperparameter optimization)
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## 📈 Highlights

- ✅ Transformer from scratch in PyTorch
- ✅ Custom sequence-to-sequence training for 5-day multi-step forecasting
- ✅ R² and MAE tracked across horizon lengths
- ✅ Comparisons to classical ML baselines
